    A SEM defines the causal relationships amongst a given set of nodes. This class provides methods to sample data
    from the observational and interventional distributions of the SEM.

    A SEMs have a batch shape: `batch_shape_f + batch_shape_g`

    In general, a SEM has a batch shape corresponding to `functions shape + graphs shape` specified as `batch_shape_f`
    and `batch_shape_g` respectively. This allows for batched processing of different functions (e.g. interventions on
    the same nodes) on different graphs. Samples and noise are broadcast to include this shape before calling the
    functional relationships.
